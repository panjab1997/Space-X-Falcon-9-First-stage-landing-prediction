## Space X Falcon 9 First-stage landing prediction

### Project background and context
SpaceX advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website, with a cost of 62 million dollars; other providers cost upward of 165 million dollars each, much of the savings is because SpaceX can reuse the first stage. Therefore, if we can determine if the first stage will land, we can determine the cost of a launch. This information can be used if an alternate company wants to bid against SpaceX for a rocket launch.

### Common problems that needed solving.
- What influences if the rocket will land successfully?
- The effect each relationship with certain rocket variables will impact in determining the success rate of a successful landing.
- What conditions does SpaceX have to achieve to get the best results and ensure the best rocket success landing rate.

### Methodology

Data collection methodology:
****SpaceX Rest API 
****(Web Scrapping) from Wikipedia
Performed data wrangling (Transforming data for Machine Learning)
